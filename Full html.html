	<p>PLEASE NOTE : The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in monumental demand for bicycles. World-wide inventory has been diminished beyond comprehension. Selection and choice are still extremely limited until the 2022’s begin to arrive… most of which will not be available until the latter half of the season. In the meantime, your patience and understanding is greatly appreciated.</p><br><br>

	<u><h2><b>A few words on shipping & bike prices</b></h2></u>
	<h3><b>It is very important to know that as we more forward into the 2022 season and begin to receive new products from our vendors, we are going to be dealing with additional costs brought forth to us due to the every increasing expense of freight. Bicycles are not cheap to ship.</b><br>
		<b>We have already begun to experience this with a number of vendors:</b><br>
		<b>2022 Specialized Bicycles will now incur an additional $50/unit (this cost has already been added to items on this site)</b><br>
		<b>2022 Specialized eBikes will now incur an additional $70/unit (this cost has already been added to items on this site)</b><br>
		<b>2022 Rocky Mountain Bicycles will now incur an additional $30/unit (this cost has already been added to items on this site)</b><br>
		<b>Please note: Current Bike Supply is Extremely Volatile. ETA can/will change. Price of bikes will be current MSRP day of Delivery – expect a possible increase due to unknown market influences and unforeseen vendor price changes.</b><br></h3>

	<h2>DOLCE FAR NIENTE: A YAMAHA XT 600 SCRAMBLER BY FREERIDE</h2>
	<img src="yamaha-xt-600-scrambler.jpg" alt="">
		<p>THE SHEER DIVERSITY of Freeride Motos Racing’s stable makes it difficult to lump them into one silo. You’re just as likely to find a svelte supermoto in their workshop, as you are a 90-year-old Moto Guzzi. Shop boss Pierre Dhers is clearly onto a good thing—so it’s no wonder that he gets return customers.

		One such customer is Dakar Rally driver and flat track racer Pierre Lachaume. The two Pierres met some time ago when Monsieur Lachaume wanted a custom bike. He wanted his 1989 Yamaha XT 600 modified at first, but, after some deliberation, Freeride built him a stunning KTM flat tracker instead.</p>
		<img src="yamaha-xt-600-scrambler-1.jpg" alt="">
		
		<p>Patience is a virtue that he clearly possesses. Once the KTM was done, he headed back to Freeride’s workshop to get the XT 600 sorted too.

			“After having completed other projects together, the subject of the XT came back on the table,” explains Pierre Dhers. “We wanted a simple and refined scrambler, a perfect way to get to the corner bar for a drink.”</p>

			If you were unaware, the French once had a booming national motorcycle trade, which pumped out some beautiful machinery (give it a Google). Freeride took inspiration from post-war French motorcycles, by fitting the fuel tank from a 1950s Monet Goyon. The oil tank and toolbox were lifted from a 125 cc Terrot. The brass fuel and oil tank caps were hand-turned by Pierre’s father. who regularly contributes to Freeride projects. The brushed aluminum accents on the tank and the small luggage rack are period parts that were restored for the project.</p>
